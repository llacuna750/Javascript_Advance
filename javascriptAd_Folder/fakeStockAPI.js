/* App requirements:

  - The app should display the name, symbol, and price of the stock, with a timestamp as per the screenshot.

  - The triangle compares the current stock price to its previous price. If the price has increased, it should be a green triangle pointing up, if the price has decreased it should be a red triangle pointing down, and if there has been no change it should be a grey triangle pointing to the right.

  - The price should update every 1.5 seconds.

    Challenge:

    1. Find a way to get fresh stock data every 1.5 seconds.

    2. Call the renderStockTicker function with the fresh data.

    3. Add logic to renderStockTicker to display the correct information.

    üîç You will need to write code here in index.js and in fakeStockAPI.js.
